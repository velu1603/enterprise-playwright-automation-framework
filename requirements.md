### 2.8 Password Encryption

- **Objective:** Securely manage and use passwords in test scenarios.

### 2.9 Code Quality

- **Objective:** Enforce coding standards and maintain high-quality code.

### 2.10 CI/CD Integration

- **Objective:** Seamlessly integrate the framework with CI/CD pipelines.

### 2.11 Reusable Utilities

- **Objective:** Develop modular and reusable utilities to optimize code maintenance.

### 2.12 Data Generation

- **Objective:** Generate test data dynamically to ensure diverse test scenarios.

### 2.13 Parallel Testing

- **Objective:** Execute tests concurrently for faster feedback and optimized test suite execution.

### 2.14 API Mocking/Testing

- **Objective:** Mock and test Salesforce APIs to validate backend functionality.

## 3. Test Scenarios (Sample)

### 3.1 Page Object Model Class and basic test

**Scenario:** Verify creation of Page class for loign page and create basic test.

**Steps:**
1. Create POM Class for login page.
2. Create Tests using Page class and its methods to login.
   - Log in to Salesforce.
   - Verify the success of login


### 3.2 Data-Driven Testing

**Scenario:** Verify creation of Salesforce records using different sets of data.

**Steps:**
1. Retrieve test data from an external source.
2. For each set of data:
   - Log in to Salesforce.
   - Create a new record with the provided data.
   - Verify the record creation is successful.

### 3.3 Logging

**Scenario:** Validate detailed logging during a complex transaction.

**Steps:**
1. Initiate a complex transaction in Salesforce.
2. Perform a series of steps.
3. Log intermediate results, status, and any errors at each step.
4. Verify the log file for expected entries and error messages.

### 3.4 Retry Mechanism

**Scenario:** Test automatic retry of a failed Salesforce login.

**Steps:**
1. Introduce a temporary failure in Salesforce login.
2. Configure the framework to retry the login.
3. Verify that the login is successful after the configured retries.

### 3.5 Self-Healing

**Scenario:** Validate self-healing for a changed Salesforce page structure.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a stable element on a Salesforce page.
2. Introduce a change in the structure of the identified element.
3. Execute a scenario that relies on the changed element.
4. Verify that the framework dynamically adjusts, and the scenario passes.

### 3.6 Cross-Browser Testing

**Scenario:** Verify Salesforce application on different browsers.

**Steps:**
1. Configure the test to run on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
2. Log in to Salesforce and perform key transactions on each browser.
3. Verify consistent behavior across different browsers.

### 3.7 Multiple Environments

**Scenario:** Test Salesforce functionality in different environments.

**Steps:**
1. Configure the test to run in a Salesforce sandbox, developer edition, and production.
2. Execute test scenarios in each environment.
3. Verify that the application behaves as expected in different Salesforce environments.

### 3.8 Password Encryption

**Scenario:** Securely use an encrypted password for Salesforce login.

**Steps:**
1. Encrypt a Salesforce login password using the framework's encryption mechanism.
2. Log in to Salesforce using the encrypted password.
3. Verify successful login with the encrypted password.

### 3.9 Code Quality

**Scenario:** Enforce coding standards in Salesforce automation scripts.

**Steps:**
1. Perform a code review for adherence to coding standards.
2. Identify and correct any code quality issues.
3. Use static code analysis tools to ensure code quality.

### 3.10 CI/CD Integration

**Scenario:** Integrate Salesforce automation with CI/CD pipeline.

**Steps:**
1. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger Salesforce test automation.
2. Monitor pipeline execution for successful integration.

### 3.11 Reusable Utilities

**Scenario:** Validate reuse of utility functions in Salesforce tests.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a common functionality shared across multiple tests.
2. Implement a reusable utility function.
3. Use the utility function in multiple test scenarios.

### 3.12 Data Generation

**Scenario:** Generate dynamic test data for Salesforce testing.

**Steps:**
1. Create a test scenario that requires dynamic test data.
2. Implement a data generation utility.
3. Execute the test scenario with dynamically generated data.
4. Verify the correct handling of dynamic data.

### 3.13 Parallel Testing

**Scenario:** Execute Salesforce tests concurrently for optimized execution.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a suite of test scenarios suitable for parallel execution.
2. Configure the framework for parallel test execution.
3. Execute the identified test suite concurrently.

### 3.14 API Mocking/Testing

**Scenario:** Mock and test Salesforce API interactions.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a Salesforce API used in a test scenario.
2. Implement a mock for the identified API.
3. Execute the test scenario, validating interaction with the mock API.

## Note:

- Adapt these scenarios to match specific Salesforce application and the intricacies of framework.
- Regularly update the documentation to reflect changes and additions to features and scenarios.
